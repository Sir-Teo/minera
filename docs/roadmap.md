Awesome—let’s map a lightweight, scalable path you can execute on a MacBook (Apple Silicon or Intel). The strategy below keeps the core minimal and fast on CPU first, with clean seams for future GPU/cluster scale‑ups. You’ll get something usable early (rigid bodies + particles + simple fluids), then layer in multi‑physics coupling and a Python API.

⸻

Tech stack (lean + Mac‑friendly)

Language: C++20 (fast, portable, slim binaries)
Build: CMake + Ninja (no heavy package manager)
Math: Eigen (header‑only) or Apple Accelerate (BLAS/FFT; already on macOS)
Threads: C++ std::thread / thread pool + Grand Central Dispatch (libdispatch)
Optional Python API: pybind11 (single small dependency)
I/O: VTK (VTU/VTP) or simple CSV/NPZ for quick plotting in Python/ParaView
Tests/CI: GoogleTest (small) + GitHub Actions (macOS + Linux runners)

GPU is optional later via Metal compute (Mac‑native). Keep CPU baseline first—lighter and easier.

Milestone roadmap (step‑by‑step)

0) Bootstrap & guardrails

Goal: a clean, warning‑free, sanitizer‑friendly codebase you can trust.
	•	Create repo, enable ‑Wall ‑Wextra ‑Werror; set C++20; add ASan/UBSan configs.
	•	Add clang‑format + clang‑tidy; pre‑commit hooks.
	•	Set up GitHub Actions on macos-latest and ubuntu-latest.
	•	Decide license (BSD‑3 or MIT).
	•	Add tiny logging (SIM_LOG(...)) and scoped profiler (timestamps, thread id).

Deliverable: “Hello engine” binary that runs a dummy step loop.

⸻

1) Core data & units (light but safe)

Goal: common types and memory layout optimized for cache.
	•	Implement Units (simple strong typedefs for Meter, Second, Kilogram; compile‑time scale factors). Keep it tiny—don’t bring a full units lib.
	•	SoA containers for particles/bodies/grids:
	•	ParticleSet: positions (AoS for ergonomics or SoA for speed), velocities, mass, id.
	•	RigidBodySet: pose, lin/ang velocity, inertia, shapes (sphere/box/capsule), material.
	•	Grid3D: uniform cells; fields (pressure, density, vel).
	•	Thread‑safe handle/ID system for stable references across modules.

Deliverable: unit tests verifying layout, alignment, and basic operations.

⸻

2) Time integrators & scheduler

Goal: a small task graph that supports sub‑stepping and coupling.
	•	Integrators: semi‑implicit Euler, Velocity‑Verlet, RK4 (template over state).
	•	Scheduler:
	•	Register “systems” as tasks with declared inputs/outputs.
	•	Support substepping (e.g., 4× SPH substeps per 1× rigid step).
	•	Deterministic order; barrier points; simple dependency DAG.
	•	Add fixed‑timestep loop and optional adaptive CFL for fluids.

Deliverable: run N dummy tasks with substeps; deterministic outputs in tests.

⸻

3) Rigid body MVP (macro, classical)

Goal: fast, simple, real‑time‑ish rigid bodies.
	•	Broadphase: uniform grid or sweep‑and‑prune (start grid; simpler on CPU).
	•	Narrowphase: analytic shapes first (sphere/box/capsule).
	•	Contacts: persistent manifolds.
	•	Solver: projected Gauss‑Seidel (PGS) for contacts/friction; Baumgarte bias.
	•	Integration: semi‑implicit Euler + quaternion normalization.
	•	Parallelism: per‑island solve in parallel using a thread pool / GCD.

Deliverable: example: 2D/3D box stack drop; stable piles at 60–240 Hz on CPU.

⸻

4) Particle MD MVP (micro, classical)

Goal: minimal MD (Lennard‑Jones) with good neighbor lists.
	•	Neighbor search: cell lists + Verlet lists with skin; rebuild heuristics.
	•	Forces: LJ 12‑6 with cutoff; optional tail correction.
	•	Integrators: Velocity‑Verlet + thermostats (Berendsen → later Nosé–Hoover).
	•	Boundary: periodic boxes; minimum image convention.
	•	Parallelism: domain tile loop parallelized with thread pool.
	•	Observables: energy, temperature, RDF bins.

Deliverable: LJ gas/liquid example (NVE/NVT), energy drift test, RDF sanity.

⸻

5) Simple fluids MVP (macro continuum)

Goal: a compact SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamics) or Stable Fluids grid.
	•	Pick SPH for one code path (unified with particle infra):
	•	Kernels: Poly6 (density), Spiky (pressure), viscosity term.
	•	Equation of state (Tait); CFL timestep.
	•	Solid boundaries via ghost particles or boundary sampling.
	•	Or grid‑based Stable Fluids (staggered MAC grid, semi‑Lagrangian advection) if you prefer grids. SPH reuses MD neighbor infra; lighter overall.

Deliverable: dam‑break or tank slosh demo; density/volume conservation metrics.

⸻

6) Coupling v1 (make it multi‑physics)

Goal: simple couplers with clear data contracts.
	•	RB ⇄ SPH (FSI‑lite):
	•	Sample pressure/viscous forces from fluid particles near RB surface → apply as net force/torque.
	•	Two‑way: RB imposes no‑penetration and adds repulsive/contact‑like forces to nearby SPH particles.
	•	Substepping: SPH×k per RB×1.
	•	MD ⇄ Continuum (coarse‑graining demo):
	•	Define a handshake region; average MD density/temperature → feed into SPH EOS locally.
	•	Optionally apply constraint to MD boundary atoms to match continuum velocity (Dirichlet BC).

Deliverable: falling box splashing SPH fluid; MD pocket embedded in fluid with stable exchange.

⸻

7) Minimal API & CLI

Goal: use it easily without touching C++.
	•	C API (stable): create world, add ParticleSet/RB/Grid, attach modules, run, fetch arrays.
	•	Python bindings (optional but recommended): pybind11 over the C API for zero‑copy numpy views.
	•	CLI runner: sim run scene.yaml (YAML/JSON) describing modules, parameters, timesteps, outputs.

Deliverable: 10–30‑line Python examples:
	•	RB pile drop
	•	LJ fluid at target temperature
	•	Dam‑break
	•	RB⇄SPH coupling

⸻

8) I/O, inspection, and plotting

Goal: lightweight visibility into results.
	•	Writers: VTK (VTU for particles/grids, VTP for surfaces) + CSV of scalars.
	•	Checkpoints: binary snapshot of state (memory‑layout aware).
	•	Debug visualizer (optional): tiny Dear ImGui + Metal viewer (wireframe + points). If you want lean, skip GUI and use ParaView/Jupyter.

Deliverable: scripts to open outputs in ParaView + Python notebooks to plot energy, RDF, mass conservation.

⸻

9) Performance pass (Mac‑specific wins)

Goal: squeeze the CPU without bloat.
	•	Threading: work‑stealing thread pool; pin long tasks; avoid false sharing.
	•	SIMD: rely on clang auto‑vectorization; where hot, add small intrinsics kernels (NEON on Apple Silicon). Keep them isolated behind simcore/math/.
	•	Accelerate/vDSP: optional path for dot/GEMV/FFT if you need them (free on macOS).
	•	Memory: SoA, contiguous pools; structure hot loops to be branch‑light; cache neighbor list reuse.
	•	Profiling: use Apple Instruments and perfetto markers; keep flamegraphs in perf/.

Deliverable: 2–5× speedup on hot loops vs naive baselines; keep binary small.

⸻

10) Validation & correctness

Goal: confidence before adding complexity.
	•	RB tests: single sphere under gravity analytic position; contact restitution tests.
	•	MD tests: energy drift (NVE), temperature control (NVT), RDF peak locations.
	•	SPH tests: hydrostatic column, dam‑break height vs time; mass conservation.
	•	Coupling tests: momentum conservation across interfaces.

Deliverable: ctest suite that runs fast on a MacBook; CI badges.

⸻

11) Extensibility seams (future‑proof, still light)

Goal: make it easy to add physics without touching the core.
	•	Plugin ABI: modules compile to .dylib; discovered by name/metadata; versioned C ABI (keep it tiny).
	•	Data contracts: each module declares fields it reads/writes (density, pressure, rb_forces), validated at load.
	•	Policies: coding guide, perf checklist, unit tests required for new modules.

Deliverable: example third‑party module (e.g., MPM or cloth) living in examples/modules/third_party.

⸻

12) Optional advanced steps (when you’re ready)
	•	Metal compute backend: rewrite just the hottest kernels (neighbor force, pressure projection) with MSL; keep CPU fallback.
	•	Domain decomposition (MPI) for cluster scale: out‑of‑scope for a MacBook but design scheduler so tasks can be remote in the future.
	•	FEM module for solids (linear tetra, corotational), then stronger FSI.
	•	QM/MM bridge (driver that talks to an external QM code) if quantum is needed—start via file/RPC, not embedded.

⸻

Design choices that keep it lightweight
	•	CPU‑first with excellent threading, tiny deps, and cache‑friendly data; no mandatory GPU or MPI.
	•	Header‑only where possible (Eigen, pybind11) to avoid build system sprawl.
	•	Single binary + dlopen modules instead of a huge monolith.
	•	One good solver per domain (PGS for contacts, Velocity‑Verlet for MD, SPH for fluids) before adding alternates.
	•	Stable C ABI + optional Python—small surface, easy scripting.

⸻

Example “first working build” checklist
	•	simcore builds with sanitizers; tests pass.
	•	RB demo: 200 boxes pile up without explosions.
	•	MD demo: 10k LJ particles, stable energy in NVE.
	•	SPH demo: dam‑break with plausible splash; mass loss < 1–2%.
	•	Coupled RB⇄SPH: falling box experiences buoyancy/drag; no jitter.
	•	Python script runs all four demos and writes VTU/CSV.

Practical Mac setup

# Tools
xcode-select --install
brew install cmake ninja llvm googletest
# (Optional) Python bindings
brew install python
# Clone deps (header-only) as submodules
git submodule add https://github.com/eigenteam/eigen-git-mirror external/eigen
git submodule add https://github.com/pybind/pybind11 external/pybind11

CMake flags you’ll use a lot:

cmake -B build -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
  -DSIM_ENABLE_PYTHON=ON -DSIM_ENABLE_SANITIZERS=ON
ninja -C build


⸻

What to postpone (to stay light)
	•	Advanced collision shapes (start with sphere/box/capsule).
	•	Multiple integrators/solvers per domain (one solid default first).
	•	Complex mesh FEM (do mass‑spring or corotational later).
	•	Distributed MPI and heavy I/O stacks (HDF5) until you need them.
	•	Full GUI—ParaView + simple scripts are enough for now.
